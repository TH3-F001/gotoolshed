# GoToolshed üõ†Ô∏è

**GoToolshed** is a collection of re-usable Go packages that I've built over time. While there's no overarching theme to the collection, these tools are designed to be modular and useful in a variety of projects.

## Available Packages

| Package       | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [Stack](./stack/README.md) | A generic stack implementation in Go, allowing any type with a `Contains` method that only works for comparable types. |

More packages will be added as they are developed.

## Getting Started

You can include GoToolshed packages in your projects by running the following Go command:

```bash
go get github.com/yourusername/gotoolshed
